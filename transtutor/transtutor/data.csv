Apr 23 2021 02:59 PM,Writing,Essay,"Akshat and Rishita Jindal immigrated to the US from India 10 years ago with their daughters,...","Akshat and Rishita Jindal immigrated to the US from India 10 years ago with their daughters, Samriddhi and Charvi, who were 5 and 3 years old at the time, respectively. They had suffered the loss of their eldest daughter, Prisha, before they came to the US. But, Akshat and Rishita had Adamya, who was born in the US.    Akshat’s parents later emigrated from India to join Akshat and his family. They reside together in the same household as they did when they lived in India. The health of his father, Aadit, is declining, though his Mother, Dhriti, remains strong.    Samriddhi was just 3 years old when her big sister, Prisha, died. She remembers her sister as a sickly child who required all of her mother’s attention and care. Samriddhi and Charvi were cared for by their grandparents while their mother tended to Prisha’s needs and their father was at work. After Prisha’s death, their mother was distraught. It was common for the sisters to go several weeks without interacting with their mother, who spent most of her time in bed, sleeping. Aadit and Dhriti did their best to care for the children, since their mother could not. They were particularly saddened for Charvi who was not breastfed, nor did she get to sleep with her parents during her first year of life. The grandparents continued caring for the children until the family moved to the United States. The grandparents, Aadit and Dhriti, felt disrespected and were angered by Akshat’s betrayal of the family. The Jindal family had been in the same village for 9 generations! As their only son, they worried about who would care for them in their old age, and they missed their grandchildren tremendously.    The move for the Jindal family was difficult in many ways. Samriddhi and Charvi missed their grandparents deeply. They also missed the familiar Hindi language, their favorite foods, and the comfort of the many people from their small village who were like an extended family. The move, however, seemed to help their mother, Rishita. She spent less time sleeping and more time with the girls while their father, an engineer, worked, often late into the evening hours. The three spent all of their time together, much of which was devoted to learning English. While not as stern as their grandparents, their mother was a firm disciplinarian. She expected much from the girls, especially when it came to academics; less than 100% was unacceptable. Complaints were not tolerated, and disobedience would result in physical punishment by both parents. For 2 years, they studied English and embraced many cultural experiences, which helped to dull the pain of homesickness. Things got even better for Samriddhi and Charvi when they started school and made friends. Rishita even befriended a group of ladies she had met at the girls’ school. She enjoyed socializing with them, much to the displeasure of Akshat who expected his wife to abide by traditional Indian customs. Their arguments worsened; it was not uncommon for Akshat to strike his wife. The girls often overheard these fights, but Rishita consistently dismissed the bruises left by her husband. Soon, their brother Adamya was born. Their father was elated at the birth of a son. For the first time ever, their father interacted lovingly with his wife, who had finally given him a son.    Sam and Char, as they now preferred to be called, thrived at school. Academically, their mother’s diligence prepared them well. Socially, they were eager playmates who reveled in opportunities and adventures that appeared to be underwhelming and typical to their American peers. They wanted to participate in everything from karate and dance, to playing soccer and guitar. For years, they begged their parents for permission to participate in these extracurricular activities, but their interests were dismissed as “not for girls” and “an unnecessary waste of time that should be devoted to studying.” Good study habits were important in order to become a physician, or an engineer, as their parents expected. At last, their father surrendered to “another Western idea” and agreed to allow each girl to choose one activity with the understanding that if their school work was compromised, the activity would be discontinued. Their daughters were abiding by the arrangement. Akshat and Rishita enjoyed attending their games and concerts, and even made a few social acquaintances, but Adamya remained the apple of his father’s eye.    Sam and Char were 16 and 14 when their grandparents left India and moved in with them. They treasured the fond memories they had of their grandparents, yet were filled with mixed emotions when they arrived. Dhirti was strong as ever, but Aadit had become old and frail, and required much assistance from Dhirti. At first, there were hugs and tears of joy, then came the questions, comments, and criticism. Both grandparents refused to call the children by their preferred Western names and were not shy about expressing their overall disapproval of the family’s lifestyle. Aadit berated his son for not being the leader in his own home; Dhirti apologized for not choosing him a better wife. Dhirti was appalled at what she called “frivolous parenting” and even took it upon herself to spank Adam for turning on the TV while his grandfather was napping. Dhirti accused Sam and Char of bringing shame to the family with their “indecent” clothing and casual interactions with boys. The children tried, to no avail, to share Western customs with their grandparents, who perceived this as disrespect. Conflict escalated with all family members, but the last straw was when Dhirti and Aadit insisted on returning with their granddaughters to India where they would marry like a “respectable” Indian female. Akshat, the leader of his home, informed his parents that his family had embraced a multicultural life in America where they intended to stay. Dhirti and Aadit returned to India where they were welcomed by their many life-long friends who helped Dhirti care for Aadit throughout his remaining days.

Both theories also might have an essential factor in explaining the various elements of parents' behaviors in dealing with their child. Both approaches are also considered well-established that people more easily encode or get new information consistent or aligned with an existing psychological model or basis that they hold.   			 We need to be aware that there are various dynamics in parenting. Theories about child-rearing—whether lay or scientific—are essential because they help us understand parenting and prescribe how parents could be guided in dealing with their children.

Effective communication in an ED is a primary contributor to patient satisfaction and safety and clinician job gratification and retention (Pun, Matthiessen, Murray, & Slade, 2015). According to Lloyd, Skarratts, Robinson, & Reid (2000), effective clinician-patient communication is a critical clinician function that healthcare systems cannot delegate. Indeed, “treating every patient politely and considerately, listening to and respecting their views, giving them information in a way that they can understand, and respecting their right to be fully involved in decisions about their care are duties of doctors” (Lloyd et al., 2000). Communicative risks and challenges in EDs arise directly from the significant and growing contextual complexity of the ED environment (Pun et al., 2015). Research shows that this complexity emanates from several factors: increased demand, the twenty-four-hour care, the episodic and short-term nature of emergency care and its influence on clinician-patient relations, linguistic and cultural diversity of patients and clinicians, and cross-disciplinary and cross-level teams

Besides being international rock stars, theyall use theatrical backdrops designed and manufactured by custom drapery maker Sew What? Inc.Based in Rancho Dominguez, California, Sew What? provides custom theatrical draperies and fabrics forstages, concerts, fashion shows, and special events worldwide and has become an industry leader inrock-and-roll staging.Founded in 1992 by Australian-born Megan Duckett, Sew What? has grown from a tiny kitchen-and-garage operation to a multimillion-dollar enterprise, thanks to Duckett’s never-say-no approach tocustomer satisfaction. “When I see a problem, I just don’t back down. I find a way to overcome it and Iuse everybody I know to help me,” she says.What made it possible for a one-woman business that started in a kitchen to evolve and grow into amultimillion dollar company with 35 employees? Megan Duckett attributes her success to hard work,quality workmanship, and especially information technology.Sew What? has enjoyed explosive growth in recent years, reaching $4 million per year in sales by theend of 2006. Company president Duckett credits much of her firm’s rapid growth to its ability toleverage information technology and the Internet to drive sales. “Before we put up our Web site,sewwhatinc.com, our business was almost all local,” says Duckett. “But after launching the Web sitethree years ago, we now have clients all over the world. In fact, last year our revenue grew 45% on theprevious year’s sales, and this year we are on target to enjoy a 65% increase on 2005 sales. And nearlyall that growth came from Web-driven sales.” Although the company’s Web site may take center stage, managing all the business the site brings inrequires a lot of effort behind the scenes. In particular, Duckett relies on a solid IT infrastructure to helpkeep the company running smoothly. “We are a customer-centric company,” notes Duckett. “It’s criticalthat we have excellent back-office information technology to manage the business and deliveroutstanding service to our customers.”Sew What? runs most of its business with Intuit’s QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions Manufacturing andWholesale Edition software and Microsoft’s Windows Server operating system installed on a DellPowerEdge 860 server, sporting an Intel Xeon processor and 146 gigabytes of disk storage. According toDuckett, “Running our business requires a lot of storage. In addition to customer information and vitaloperational and financial QuickBooks files, we need to store thousands of drapery and fabric image files,customer instruction document files, and other types of data.” Sew What?’s additional computersupport includes an older Dell PowerEdge 500 server dedicated to a few smaller applications and avariety of Dell desktop PC systems for employees. Sew What? started in 1992 as a part-time endeavor, with Duckett cutting and sewing fabric on herkitchen table. She went full time in 1997 and incorporated in 1998. The important role technology playsin running a successful small business hit home when she lost a big contract. The potential client saidthat without a Web site, her company “lacked credibility.” “Before losing that contract, I thought, ‘I runa sewing business, a cottage craft. I don’t need a Web site,” she says. Duckett admits she was rathercocky, mainly because she had grown her business “quite well” by word of mouth alone. “I quicklylearned the error of that thought process. You can’t have that attitude and stick around,” sheacknowledges.Losing the contract also coincided with a period of low growth between 2001 and 2002. That’s whenDuckett decided to embrace technology. Using Microsoft Publisher, she designed and built her own Website. “You figure things out and learn how to do it yourself when budgets are thin,” she admits.Duckett kept working to improve the site and make it better for her customers. A year later, feeling thatthe site needed refreshing, she signed up for a 10-week course in Dreamweaver and again completelyrebuilt the site. Yet another Web site reconstruction helped Sew What? grow into a company withcustomers around the world and a clientele list that includes international rock stars, Gucci, and RollingStone magazine.In 2005, Duckett decided she needed to improve the site’s navigation because “I wanted it to be sleekand to provide a really good customer experience. That was beyond my abilities, so we hired a Webmarketing consulting company to build a custom navigation system for the site.” She worked with thehired guns on branding, search engine optimization, overall design, and site layout. Duckett still providesall the content, including text and images. There’s also a Spanish version of the site, and theprofessionals tuned up the main site’s search features to include spelling variants for different English-speaking countries. For example, you can search for the American spelling of theater or the British andAustralian version, theatre.The site also lets potential customers review all kinds of color swatches and teaches them how tocalculate accurate measurements for their projects; the differences between a scrim, a tormentor, and atraveler curtain; the proper care and feeding of a variety of drapery materials; and a lot more.While perusing the Dell Web site one day, Duckett saw a news article about the Dell/NFIB Small BusinessExcellence Award. The National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) and Dell Inc. present thisannual prize to one small business in recognition of its innovative use of technology to improve itscustomers’ experience. The winner receives $30,000 worth of Dell products and services, a lifetimemembership to the NFIB, and a day at Dell’s headquarters with Michael Dell and other senior executives.“The description of the kinds of businesses they were looking for perfectly described Sew What?”Duckett realized. “Everything they were looking for, we’d done, so I decided to enter. My husband [andbusiness partner] laughed and reminded me that I never win anything.” Writing the essay for thecontest caused Duckett to reflect on everything she and her employees had achieved over the years:“We got to sit back and feel really proud of ourselves. Just that process was enough to invigorateeveryone in our weekly production meetings.” The contest judges also recognized Megan Duckett’s passionate commitment to customer satisfactionand use of information technology for business success, so they awarded Sew What? the Small BusinessExcellence Award. Winning the award proved to be a very emotional experience. Looking at the caliberand achievements of the nine other finalists, Duckett figured Sew What? would remain just a top-10finalist: “I could not believe that a big company like Dell—so entrepreneurial and advanced in everyway—would look at our little company and recognize it.”Like other small business owners, Duckett puts an enormous amount of physical and emotional energyinto her work. “Winning this award is so flattering on a personal level,” she says. “This business isingrained in every cell of my body, and to have someone saying, ‘Good job,’ well, in small business,nobody ever says that to you.”That may have been true previously, but Sew What?’s technology leadership and business successcontinue to earn recognition. In March 2007, the company received a Stevie Award for Women inBusiness for “most innovative company of the year” among those with up to 100 employees. A fewmonths earlier, Sew What? had received an SMB 20 Award from PC Magazine, which honors 20 of themost technologically innovative small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) each year. “Small andmedium businesses drive today’s economy. However, they often don’t get the attention and recognitionthey deserve,” said PC Magazine’s Editor-in-Chief, Jim Louderback. “We want to highlight the hard work,technological leadership, and innovative spirit of thousands of SMB companies throughout the world.”Duckett plans to use her prize winnings to add a bar code system that can track the manufacturingprocess at the company’s warehouse. In the drapery business, fabric is stored on a roll in the warehouseand then moves through different stages: receiving, cutting, sewing, shipping, and so forth. The scanningprocess will enable Duckett’s team to track how long the fabric stays in any given stage. These data willgive them a better idea of their costs, which will then help them produce more accurate price lists.“We don’t need to charge an hour and a half for labor if the cutting only takes an hour and 15 minutes,”Duckett notes. Currently, the company uses a handwritten system of sign-in and sign-out sheets that,she says, takes too long and introduces too many errors. “The new system will also let us track theprogress of individual orders,” she promises. “We’ll be able to provide better service by keeping thecustomer updated. Based on the class lectures and the case answer the following questions:1) “If a building is an information system, the IT Infrastructure is its foundation”- elucidate the statement showing the components of an information system.2) How do information technologies contribute to the business success of Sew What? Inc.?"

Supervisors should take a realistic look at the mission statement and
philosophy of the organization. They should also benchmark against similar
industry organizations to see what types of policies and procedures they use
with similar service situations. Ultimately, they should work with employees to
develop realistic standards for quality service delivery. Employees should
bring issues related to poor policies and procedures to their supervisor/team
leader for discussion. They should take ownership of the issue rather than simply
complaining to others about the stress and working conditions. It is possible
that your supervisor is receiving pressure from his or her manager and is also
frustrated but cannot voice that to you or other employees (since this would be
unprofessional). If you perceive this to be the case, and you have a suggestion
box or open-door policy, try presenting suggestions for improvement in a manner
such that more senior people will hear and can potentially act upon them. Just

In addition, educators have observed a behavior between other students, also during the class day when the teacher is teaching in different areas always one or two students disturb the learning by their behaviors of not focus and not pay attention. In our classroom, the teacher and the assistant teacher all the time have in their hand a notepad and pen to write down any observation that occurs of the students, between teaching different subjects. An example of unethically collecting data would be that teachers can unethically create data by observing a student when we going to the playground such as seeing how they are playing with their classmate, how they interact with their friend, and what kind the games they like to play if they are rough or gentle, and how are they act if they have feelings for others.

But the two nations had been on a collision course for years. Japanese imperialism had folded much of East Asia into its growing empire. The United States, hoping to avoid being pulled into World War II, relied on diplomatic sanctions to curb Japanese aggression. But that only worsened relations between the rival powers. The bombing raid at Pearl Harbor sunk dozens of ships and killed thousands of sailors—but also strengthened American resolve. President Roosevelt rallied the nation as the United States entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The resounding defeat at Pearl Harbor was avenged by the eventual Allied victory, but only after years of fighting and countless deaths. In the decades that followed, the United States and Japan healed their wounds and developed close national ties. December 7th is now a day when the former adversaries unite to honor fallen comrades on both sides of this historic battle."
Apr 14 2021 08:03 AM,Writing,Essay,Creating smooth transitions in an early education classroom is vital to a productive and...,"Creating smooth transitions in an early education classroom is vital to a productive and unchaotic day. One transition strategy that I use in my preschool classroom that I find extremely helpful is a countdown to transition time. I will announce ""three minutes until clean up time and then we will... have snack, read, etc."" I will remind them at 1 minute and then when it is time to clean up. This allows the students to prepare for the current activity to end and ready themselves for the next activity. It is important to allow them that time to prepare themselves, especially if it an activity they really enjoy and have a difficult time putting away (Finley, 2017). Another transition technique that I use are visual cues. On the playground, I give the students their timed reminders, and then I will go stand in a set place when it is time to line up. The students are already aware that recess is coming to an end and when they see me stand in the lineup spot they know to head in that direction. In the classroom, when it is time to move from one activity to another I will often touch my ears. I began the year with ""If you can hear me..."" and they answer ""touch your ears"" "" and that means?"" ""listening time"". Now I simply have to touch my ears. Of course, there are days when the tried and true do not work and you have to be creative and switch things up, but finding transitions that work for your teaching style and classroom is an invaluable tool.

After three minutes we use a bell or give another verbal direction that we have to get in the line and a stamp or sticker is placed on the hand of the children who are at the line on time, for the students who struggle for these transitions we use visuals that let them know that it's time to go to class, or we bring a small favorite object they can hold until they enter the classroom. For the transition from center time to group time we use a 5 minutes warning before center time ends and we project it on the screen, at the end of five minutes an alarm sounds and the cleaning song is played, the children who are finishing cleaning can come to the carpet and dance the song until everyone finishes cleaning, for students who also struggle with this transition we use hourglasses that give them visual notice that center time is going to end and when they finish cleaning they can choose a favorite fidget for when they are sitting down during group time. These are some of the interventions that we have in the different classrooms that I have observed in my work and I would like to implement in my own classroom. comment as you see fit.

Another benefit would be that it helps with the development of communication since by practicing interactive games as well as vocalizing the process of the game we provide children with common and appropriate vocabulary ""When they play, they use plenty of their senses to capture and acquire diverse information and extend their knowledge about their environment. Moreover, children will develop new skills and abilities (e.g., talking, thinking, etc.) through playing. Also, playing provides children with the opportunity to boost their attention span, learn to get along with others, cultivate their creativity and address their social, emotional and cognitive needs"" (Lamrani, & Abdelwahed, 2020).

In general, they learn social skills, which are very important for their learning and language development (Granada (Preparatory School, 2018). When teachers incorporate play into early childhood instruction, they help develop children's cognitive, motor, and critical thinking skills. As children develop necessary thinking skills, they develop the ability to analyze and dissect information to make sense of it. They could apply it in the context of their environment. As a result, they could figure things out for themselves, asking the right questions when encountering challenges to gain clarity and make sense of their world (Granada (Preparatory School, 2018).

Tier 2 refers to students who are not making adequate progress within the core curriculum and are provided with intensive individual or small group instruction to meet their individual needs based on their performance levels and rates of progress (Feldman, n.d.). Whereas Tier 3 refers to students who receive individualized, intensive interventions specific to the student’s skill deficit and prevention of additional learning deficiencies (Feldman, n.d.). One strategy I have seen with regards to interventions in a  preschool setting for all three tiers in one lesson is grouping students in small groups and in one-on-one interventions. As preschool classrooms tend to be smaller in size, the teacher placed one tier 1 student with one or two tier 2 students in a small group with whom she will work with. She will also pair one tier 1 student with a tier 3 student when she feels the intervention is best suited.

Rendezvous management team feels confident that these six candidates can successfully open the new hotels in Jamaica. The success of these managers is vital to the success of setting up the new business, so management wants to ensure they provide effective support for them in terms of training and development. They believe that the best option is to divide training into two parts: pre-departure training and on-the-job training in the new country. Since the organization has never sent employees abroad before, they are not sure about what should be included in these training programs. The only mandatory area that must be included is an introductory language section (including basic business English and Jamaican patois/creole) so that the managers have a basic grasp of the English language and Jamaican patois/creole by the time they open the new hotels. However, they hope that the managers will enjoy their introductory language course and will continue to attend more advanced language classes when the new hotels are open.    The organization knows that training is important; but despite looking at what other companies offer, they cannot decide what the key training areas should be.                QUESTION TWO       i.

Apr 24 2021 09:02 AM,Writing,Essay,Technology has increased rapidly in the past two decades. This rapid technological advancement...,"Technology has increased rapidly in the past two decades. This rapid technological advancement has provided organizations an opportunity to participate in an international marketplace. The international marketplace is portrayed by intense pressure and competition to drive cost down. The pure transactional way of sourcing materials is not realistic in the current modern era. Organizations should look for ways to restructure the ordering process and focus on their main competencies to sustain a competitive edge in the business market. This is only possible through the development of a strategic sourcing that would help the organizations in reducing their material and procurement costs. The shifts in economic trends and global expansion of businesses have augmented the intricacy of several supply chains, which have resulted in increased demand for successful supply chain management in current marketplace. Markets have become more globalized and organizations are affected by international trade either directly through their customers and supply chain or indirectly through the competitive strategies used by their industry rivals. Many organizations have attempted to develop partnerships or alliances with other supply chain members located in foreign countries, so that they could bypass the global business barriers created through the government policies, and gain access to foreign markets by managing the market risks. The rising level of foreign direct investment in recent years is the proof of this attempt by the organizations. The trend toward economic globalization has made alliances important for corporate strategy, since globalization drove the convergence of customer preferences and needs. The high cost of speedy technological changes made it impossible for a firm to offer customers the best products at the lowest price (Baldwin, 2013). Additionally, sharing huge gaining presence and fixed costs in foreign markets were also claimed as reasons for global alliances. These alliances have helped firms in elimination of duplicated research efforts and control uncertainty in competitive environment. In addition, alliances could also stimulate more research and development investment on both sides. The benefits of global alliance ranged from lowering risk & cost of high tech product development and gaining economies of scale, to reduction in transit time of products to market. Increased innovation, flexibility, better quality, strategic advantage, and economic necessity were also given as the benefits of global alliances. In the current, competitive business setting and global economy, organizations are highly recommended to actively monitor and manage their supply chain, because the suppliers can cause serious disruptions their operations otherwise (Seuring, 2013). During 90s, the trends such as just-in-time systems, supply base reduction, globalization and lean supply chain networks have inspired the supply chain leaders to put more emphasis on cost reduction and efficiency in their supply chains’ design, along with removal of non-value added activities and slack resources in order to minimize the costs of production. In the meantime, the emergent role of global supply chains helped in bringing unification among the manufacturers and suppliers worldwide, which led to higher dependency among the organizations dealing in the supply chain and a higher level of supply chain complexity. Global production has undergone a radical evolution during the past two decades (Baldwin, 2013). Improvements in information and communications technology (ICT) along with World Trade Organization’s push for low or no trade barriers have helped in emergence of fragmented value chains in world trade, where production is no longer managed within one country but is broken up and dispersed worldwide (Elms & Low, 2013). Furthermore, the dispersion and reorganization of production processes imply that each production task is now situated in the location with the utmost comparative advantage. Through production processes sub-divided into several stages all over the world, several countries have became involved in production networks that uses several intermediate inputs to create a final good to consumers. The supply chain experts have started to focus on developing and improving supply chain strategy, planning, and operations to enhance flexibility and service quality. Supply chain managers are focusing on reducing the cost of the supply chain process to become more competitive and to deliver the best value to the end users. Nonetheless, managing supply chains in a turbulent and competitive market is challenging, due to unexpected circumstances. The frequent occurrences of labor disputes, political changes within the areas of operation and of the supply chain and natural disasters are the most critical risks that supply chain managers must minimize and control. Supply chain managers should help the organizations in improving their efficiency of informational, physical and financial flows, when there is a possibility for joint problem-solving across supply chain partners to execute best practices (Seuring, 2013). With augmented proliferation of supply chain and the liberalization of cross border transactions since the 90s, many countries have quickly embedded into the global production networks. Highly institutionalized regulatory frameworks have helped the countries in improving their sense of confidence in their economy, which have also led them to attract much more investors then they were able to attract in previously. Businesses that are operating under accountable and transparent countries might have greater chances of business sentiment and higher trust in the system as compare to the countries that have corrupt regimes. Supply chain management becomes increasingly complex when organizational operations in the delivery of products are interrupted. Supply chain interruption can have poor impact on sales and it can even push up the cost of transportation. Managers, who are able to reduce and manage supply chain risks are able to enhance the company’s competitive position more and can produce higher returns and business growth. To reduce uncertainties from the supply chain, managers need to consider risk-adjusted methods keeping in view the exact design of supply chain, as it will improve fundamental areas in the downstream and upstream of the chain in both domestic and global trade.

We also studied several paintings and instillations by white women who may have appropriated the deaths of black men for their own gain. Further, we also discussed the colonial history of exhibiting and displaying native and aboriginal bodies in portraiture and museums, hopefully recognizing the problematic nature of these works and displays. In the end, the point of the essays and the corresponding encounters with these artworks was to highlight the possible ethical quandaries that may arise when artists and museum curators fail to acknowledge their own privileges and historical dependency on other cultures and peoples. Looking to any artwork you chose (even stuff we didn’t discuss) ask if there are ethical limits to the incorporation of other cultures into our art and expression? If so, why? If not, why? You may also chose to explore the question of what responsibilities do present day art-lovers have to rewriting or transforming the artwork that historically oppressed particular cultures, e.g. native or aboriginal works?Topic 2: As many effective altruist would claim, we must abandon ourselves to complete charity and activism in order to safeguard our planet and to care for peoples and cultures in need. Some effective altruists even claimed that art is not something good for itself but only for its consequences. As such art that doesn’t effectively promote social justice may be a waste of time and resources. Please discuss how particular forms of art promote social justice, ease suffering, etc. or how despite not advancing the so-called good, such art is still good for society. Further, you may also discuss the role that art should play in the world today, in business, politics, activism. What role should it play in the humanities and in education?Topic 3: As we saw in both the last unit and this unit, visual art spans a wide spectrum. Utilizing any of the artists we discussed in class ask whether visual art is an effective vehicle for promoting social justice? How might the viewing of art simply lead to complacency or a sense that just by witnessing the art work, you have done some “good”? What does art need to do in order to be effective in promoting social justice rather than being a vehicle for voyeurism?"

You are the director of respiratory therapy at a large regional medical center. There is an 85 year old, female, Hispanic patient in the adult intensive care unit. The admitting diagnosis for the patient is ""stroke."" Prior to admission the patient had a history of heart and pulmonary problems, and lung cancer (successfully treated by surgery and radiation 10 years ago). Tests conducted since admission have discovered early stage liver cancer. The patient has been in a comatose state ever since admission, unable to communicate or move. Since Patient is unable to breathe on her own, she is also on a ventilator. The patient was admitted 15 days ago, she is without insurance and has no proof of citizenship. The hospital business office wants to know if she can be discharged from AICU which costs the hospital $9,000 per day, or if the family will agree to disconnect the ventilator. The attending physician is new on the medical staff and is unsure of the patient's prognosis. The AICU is full so the discharge planner is under pressure from his supervisor to free up the bed, which is needed for other critical patients. The patient's family has been adamant that God will perform a miracle and the patient will walk out of the hospital. They are strongly against withdrawal of any life support or of reducing any standard of care. Patient's children are all adults, natural born citizens of the U.S. who own a successful well-known local business. A local TV station has been 'covering the story' although they have not publicly disclosed the patient's name. The state governor has come out publicly stating that illegal aliens are a drain on our state's resources and should be sent back to their countries of origin. The governor's challenger (whose daughter is a nursing student in AICU) says there is a moral duty to care for everyone. You are scheduled to meet with the hospital ethics committee tomorrow. After the meeting you, the physician, and the AICU chaplain are to meet with the patient's family regarding the patient's course of care. How will you prepare for the upcoming meeting with the hospital ethics committee? What issues do you expect will come up during that meeting? What will you say to the patient's family?"

Although the primary set up is fixed, my mentor does have flex-spaces for student’s independent needs throughout the classroom. Unfortunately, not as much as she has in years previous because due to COVID our district has applied stricter guidelines with regards to both primary seating and flex-seating arrangement. With regards to her student’s grades, and once again, due to COVID, it has unfortunately caused her students to show significant academic delays as at the beginning of the school year was virtual learning and many students did not return to in-person learning until January, so academics did suffer greatly. As with many other educators, it has been a struggle for her to get her students up to the level of academic performance of where they should be this time of the year.    There are a couple UDL’s that Understood references that I would like to observe and will need to reach out to other educators to see if they do incorporate these UDL’s into their classroom. They include their teaching techniques focusing on what is taught and how, how they make accommodations for all of their students, not just those with IEP’s or 504 plans, working with individual students to determine how the students will learn the material to meet their learning goals, and other ways a student can show what they know by completing the same assignment as their peers, only in a different format. comment as you see fit min 40 words or more"

If you could sit down with him or her, I would ask him or her if we could talk about it. I will go on record and clarify to them why recess is important. Compiled from information on the authors consulted with researchers in early childhood growth. as a class time is spent during the day's blocks (one moment in the day) is set aside for physical, social, and cognitive tasks, recess was inherent could not be held to any longer It is imperative that the students take a break between activities so they have a chance to catch their breath. It is vital to me as a teacher to allow students to engage outside of the classroom as it gives them the ability to gain perspective on the class activities. They believe like being in the classroom every day means being introduced to all of the school's academic content, so this seems like a pretty good place to them. It is probably good for them to have a break from work for a while each day. By giving the students a chance to relax and have fun, recess could boost their academic performance in the classroom. One of the most important things we can do is to meet people who have similar values and ambitions. comment as you see fit. min 40 words or more"

All children for the past year have been taught not only over the computer but learning games as well. It seems as though the learning games are helping the early educational students tremendously. Games are always fun to children so when you put it in learning form it is not only fun but it helps the children remember. The disadvantages I would say that video games have is an addiction to sitting in from of a device. A lot of children tend to sit in their rooms and just eat and play games. That is why a lot of children are at a high risk of obesity in America. Video games ca also keep you away from the outside world and have you no social life. Another disadvantage would be when you look at the device for so long it puts a strain on the eyes. If I was approached by parents about playing video games I will then explain to them that I understand the advantages and disadvantages of video games.

What does the play so far suggest about early modern views of racial difference and racial stereotypes?

Write an analysis of the results addressing the key areas central to the walkthrough approach. Why am I doing this assignment? The purpose of this assignment is for you to critically think about the affordances and architecture of networked technology and to begin thinking about how the structure and features of an app are designed to shape user engagement and build an imagined networked public. The essay should consider and reflect on the ways users may resist these technical arrangements and appropriate the app technology for their own purposes. The key learning outcomes from this assignment will be 1) developing an understanding of how networked technologies are designed and used to engage users and 2) the ability to critically identify and analyse the cultural, political and social meanings embedded within apps. What do I have to do? The walkthrough method is a user-centred research approach that provides a way to critically analyse apps by engaging with an app’s interface. Essentially, the method establishes a foundational corpus of data from which researchers can build a more detailed and critical analysis of an app’s  intended purpose, embedded cultural meanings and implied ideal users and uses. Your Walkthrough Essay must analyse and discuss your chosen app’s: - Vision - Operating model - Modes of governance This assignment will involve you deploying the walkthrough technique and systematically analysing the various stages of app use including: - App registration and entry - Everyday use - Discontinuation of use You may use screenshots to support the documentation process. A good essay will move beyond descriptions of the app and will critically discuss the symbolic meanings of the features, linking them to cultural, political and social values that may be embedded within the apps. It should also consider how users may resist or appropriate the affordances on the app and how this behaviour may challenge or continue to perpetuate particular cultural values. Word Limit:1,500 words (references not included) Criteria for Marking: - Understanding and demonstration of the method - A critical and analytical evaluation of the results - An explicit and comprehensive engagement with broader themes and concepts - Supported and evidenced argument - Appropriate use of documentation - Clarity and fluency of written expression"

My family is full of gamers, so I would side with the advantages of video games for the most part, but I cannot ignore the disadvantages! Let us start with the positives, hand eye coordination skills at work, as well as problem solving, socializing virtually can be a great skill to learn, and then lastly depending on the video game there is much to learn! Now as for the disadvantages, the biggest one is time flies when you are having fun! Be careful to monitor the amount of time spent on a video game. While playing a video game the body is not moving, lack physical activity could be a concern. There are some that might caution that video games could be addicting, I believe that teaching moderation is key. One last thing I would caution a parent about is to look out for the video game ratings, and make sure that its appropriate for the age of their child. Comment as you fit. Min 40 words or more"

In these years, the employees really showed that they were really in control of the organisation. Their hard work projected the organisation to win the best performing organisation in the past five years. After these years, complacency set in and the organisation performance began to fall. Over the last four years the performance has been too serious that something urgent needs to be done to save Mpintim Company Ltd. The C.E.O Mr Kontonona indicated ‘I wanted us to remain the best performing organisation and because my Human Resource Manager was not giving me that, that is why I fired him. I can only work with people who can give me my sunk cost.’. In another statement the C.E.O said ‘we need help badly that if we do not do this we will have to close down’.    This led to the introduction of J.B. Consult to help Mpintim Company Ltd to be on its feet again. An investigation by J. B Consult found a damming result against the leadership of Mpintim. From the time the company was adjudged the best performing, management became complement and thought everything was perfect for the organisation. The C.E.O the sacked the HR Manager because he still wanted to spend on training and development which he thought was going to use a lot of money As a result, the C.E.O thought that there was no need for further training because employees performed well. J.B. Consult had to meet management to recommend immediate turnaround strategies if Mpintim Company Ltd wants to come out from its crisis.    J. B. Consult recommended a change in emphasis and strategic change where the organisation will have to plan for staff training and development ahead into the future so that Mpintim will plan ahead of time and this will put it back to footing. It was also recommended that this type of training should be for all staff because the organisations’ performance is the collective performance of individuals in the organisation and none should be left out. J. B. Consult finally recommended the introduction the KR Manager. Your staff should be and are the key assets you have as an organisation. The investment you put in the acquisition of technology should should heavily be spent on your staff because they can be used to achieve competitive advantage as you did in the past. There was the need for more training and development even when the company was judged as the best performing company. Following this advice, J. B Consult signed for the amount charged and left the company to cleaned their mess following the recommendations.    Mr. Kusumi, a new Human Resource Manager join the team as a result of the recommendations. Upon reading the recommendations he decided to put the company back to its rightful place as one of the best forming companies. He immediately carried out a training need analysis and got management commitment. This time the C.E.O was very committed to HR recommendations. Series of training programs were designed and implemented. Mr. Kusumi decided to use less costly methods having head of the dismissal of the former HR Manager. Among the methods he used for the traing were the lecture, coaching, mentoring and project assignment. He was particularly interested in Kolb’s Theory and used a lot of the reinforcement theory as well. After a year of Mr. Kusumi, Mpintim Company Ltd started to up its performance again. Management of the organisation became very happy they were returning to their former level. The HR Manager had to introduce various strategies to keep employee performance very high. Among the strategies implemented were overtime systems, work-life balance, employee voice, lunch discounts, various allowance, contingent pay and increase in basic pay. All these were introduced successfully because Mpintim has returned to its former position and even better and employee survey carried out indicated that everybody was happy. Profitability shot up and company recognition was improved."

It is also easy to simply do the things that seem immediately pleasant without a bigger life-plan in mind. This is totally natural, of course, since thinking about how to live our lives can be quite annoying and deciding to be more intentional about what we do can be truly exhausting. But while Socrates was clearly exaggerating when he said that “the unexamined life is not worth living” (of course it is!), he was certainly right in suspecting that unexamined lives often lead their subjects to the late and regrettable conclusion that their living was not worth their lives. So the truth is that simply going-through-the-motions of your life is a recipe for existential disaster down the road. It would be great if we could all avoid that. In this short paper, then, I want you to examine your life so far and your life goals moving forward, in light of our discussions of Religion and Meaning in this unit. More exactly, I want you to do three things. (A) I want you to begin by analyzing your own life until now. I want you to make a self-assessment of how meaningful it has been. This is once again an opportunity for self-improvement; an opportunity to turn a constructively critical eye to yourself. (B) I then want you to discuss the connection between Religion and Meaning in general, based on our readings, and also the connection between Religion and the meaningfulness of your life, so far, in particular. Here I want you to engage with at least one author from this unit. (C) Finally, I want you to discuss what steps you can take to improve the meaningfulness of your life going forward.

It's your opportunity to explain or expand upon the other documents you submit as part of your application. Here are our top tips to ensure you give yourself the best chance possible. If you're applying through VTAC, please visit their website for more information specific to VTAC requirements.  Focus on your experience Your personal statement could be the difference between you getting a place at Deakin or missing out. If you don't quite meet your course entry requirements or criteria, it's an alternative way for our admissions team to assess your application and learn more about you and your strengths. So don't be afraid to gloat! You should list your achievements, work experience, skills and any obstacles you've overcome. Talk about what you're good at and what you're proud of. Include any voluntary work or activities, as these are a great reflection of who you are as a person and what you believe in. This is your chance to let us know why you would make a great Deakin student or why you may not have previously performed as well as you know you could. Keep in mind that your statement should be relevant to and demonstrate your commitment and interest in the course or study area you're applying for. Allow yourself plenty of time Draft and re-draft your personal statement. If you leave it to the last minute and write it in a hurry, it will show. Allow yourself time to revise and refine, getting rid of any information that's superfluous or repeated. It may also be a good idea to get a friend, family member or colleague to look over it. Someone with fresh eyes to pick up any errors or inconsistencies you may have missed. Check your spelling and grammar It may seem obvious, but getting your spelling and grammar right is important. Choose a tense and stick with it. Watch out for spelling mistakes (spellcheck isn't always your friend – especially if your default language is American English). Make sure you aren't missing words, that capital letters are only used where they're supposed to be, and try not to repeat words, especially adjectives. Make sure your verbs agree with your nouns (for example the team was, not the team were). Keep date formats the same throughout. Use words to express numbers from one to nine and numerals for numbers 10 and over. Consistency and accuracy is key. Stick to the format Your personal statement must be submitted as a PDF so be sure to check your spacing and layout doesn't change when you convert your document. Keep margins and fonts consistent. Using lots of colours can be distracting so keep it simple and in a format that's easy to read.

Nov 25 2020 04:15 PM,Writing,Dissertation and Thesis Services,Counting all the k-mers (substrings of length k) in DNA/RNA sequencing reads...,"Counting all the k-mers (substrings of length k) in DNA/RNA sequencing reads is the preliminary step of many bioinformatics applications. However, state of the art k-mer counting methods require that a large data structure resides in memory. Such structure typically grows with the number of distinct k-mers to count. We present a new streaming algorithm for k-mer counting, called DSK (disk streaming of k-mers), which only requires a fixed, user defined amount of memory and disk space. This approach realizes a memory, time and disk trade-off. The multi-set of all k-mers present in the reads is partitioned and partitions are saved to disk. Then, each partition is separately loaded in memory in a temporary hash table. The k-mer counts are returned by traversing each hash table. Low abundance k-mers are optionally filtered. DSK is the first approach that is able to count all the 27-mers of a human genome dataset using only 4.0 GB of memory and moderate disk space (160 GB), in 17.9 hours. This lab is intended to study variations of hashing. Since the interest is primarily algorithmic efficiency, we will ignore physical device considerations. You will have 2 hashing schemes: mine and yours. Mine has three variations. You will have three collision handling strategies: linear probing, quadratic probing, and chaining. You will have two variations on the table structure: bucket of size one or buckets of size three. The table below shows all the combinations that you need to handle.
